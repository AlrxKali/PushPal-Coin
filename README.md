## 6. Vendor Pricing & Conversions

PushPal’s marketplace uses **PPC as the customer currency**, while vendors get paid in their **local currency**.

### Conversion Rate
- **$1 USD = 1,000 PPC**
- Example: a $25 product = **25,000 PPC** (before fees/taxes).

### Customer Purchases
- Customers pay in PPC.
- The displayed price already includes **taxes and service fees**.  
- Example:  
  - Vendor sets product price = **$25**.  
  - Base conversion = **25,000 PPC**.  
  - Taxes + fees = **+4,000 PPC**.  
  - **Displayed price to customer = 29,000 PPC**.

### Vendor Withdrawals
- Vendors withdraw earnings in their local currency.  
- Conversion back: **1,000 PPC = $1 USD**.  
- Example:  
  - Customer pays **29,000 PPC** for a product.  
  - Vendor keeps listing price and withdraws = **$25 USD** (before any payout processing fees if applicable. If there is any applicable fee due to local regulation, processing service, etc, we will let you know when you apply for content creator or vendor account. Transparency is our priority).

## 7. Notes for Vendors

- Always set the **base price in USD (or local currency)** when uploading products.  
- PushPal will automatically convert it to PPC and add applicable **taxes/fees**.  
- Customers will only see the **final PPC price** (including fees).  
- Vendors see both:  
  - The **base amount they earn**.  
  - The **final customer-facing PPC price**.
